# AI Chatbot Infrastructure - Design Decisions and Security Considerations

## Overview

This repository provides production-grade Terraform modules for building scalable AI chatbot infrastructure on AWS. The modules are designed with security, performance, and cost optimization in mind, specifically for generative AI workloads using OpenSearch Serverless vector databases and large language models.

## Architecture Components

### 1. OpenSearch Serverless Vector Database Module (`modules/opensearch-vector-db`) ⭐ **PRIMARY**

- Access logging enabled for audit trails

## Design Decisions

### 1. OpenSearch-First Architecture

**Decision**: Use OpenSearch Serverless as the primary vector database instead of S3-based storage

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Near real-time similarity search with sub-100ms latency
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture automatically scales with demand
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model with no idle costs
- **Native Vector Support**: Built-in k-NN algorithms optimized for ML workloads
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS AI/ML services

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher per-query cost compared to S3, but significantly better performance
- Regional availability may be limited compared to S3
- More complex than simple object storage but provides advanced search capabilities

### 2. Modularity and Reusability

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific service with clear boundaries
- **Environment Agnostic**: Modules work across dev, staging, and production environments
- **Parameterized Configuration**: Extensive variable support for customization
- **Provider Flexibility**: Support for multiple AWS regions and cross-region scenarios

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **OpenSearch Serverless**: Sub-100ms vector similarity search with automatic scaling
- **Lambda Provisioned Concurrency**: Eliminates cold start latency for critical workloads
- **Memory Optimization**: Configurable memory allocation up to 10GB for large models
- **Architecture Support**: Both x86_64 and ARM64 (Graviton) for cost optimization
- **k-NN Algorithm Optimization**: Configurable similarity metrics for different use cases

### 4. Security-First Approach

- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Network Isolation**: VPC deployment with private subnets and endpoints
- **IAM Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions with resource-specific policies
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance requirements
- **Fine-grained Access Control**: Collection and index-level permissions

### 5. Cost Optimization

- **Serverless Architecture**: Pay-per-use pricing for OpenSearch and Lambda
- **Intelligent Storage**: Automatic transition to cheaper storage tiers for S3 backup
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated cleanup of old data
- **ARM64 Support**: Up to 20% cost reduction for Lambda functions
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand

### 6. Operational Excellence

- **CloudWatch Integration**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all components
- **X-Ray Tracing**: Performance analysis and debugging across services
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Error handling and retry logic
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for analysis
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring for OpenSearch and Lambda

## OpenSearch Configuration Decisions

### 1. Collection vs Provisioned Clusters

**Decision**: Use OpenSearch Serverless collections instead of provisioned clusters

**Rationale**:
- **Simplified Management**: No cluster sizing or capacity planning required
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual usage without idle costs
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance

### 2. Vector Search Configuration

**Decision**: Support multiple similarity metrics with configurable parameters

**Implementation**:
```hcl
# Vector search configuration
opensearch_similarity_metric = "cosine"  # or "euclidean", "dot_product"
opensearch_vector_dimension = 1536       # Match embedding model
opensearch_vector_engine    = "nmslib"   # Optimized for performance
```

### 3. Index Template Management

**Decision**: Automatically create and manage index templates for vector fields

**Benefits**:
- Consistent vector field configuration
- Optimized search performance
- Simplified index management
- Version control for schema changes

## Security Considerations

### 1. OpenSearch Data Protection

```hcl
# OpenSearch Serverless encryption and security policies
resource "aws_opensearchserverless_security_policy" "encryption" {
  name = "${var.collection_name}-encryption"
  type = "encryption"
  policy = jsonencode({
    Rules = [
      {
        Resource = ["collection/${var.collection_name}"]
        ResourceType = "collection"
      }
    ]
    AWSOwnedKey = true
  })
}
```

### 2. Network Security

```hcl
# VPC configuration for Lambda with OpenSearch access
vpc_config = {
  subnet_ids         = ["subnet-private-1", "subnet-private-2"]
  security_group_ids = ["sg-lambda-ai-opensearch"]
}

# VPC endpoint for OpenSearch Serverless
resource "aws_opensearchserverless_vpc_endpoint" "this" {
  name       = "${var.collection_name}-vpc-endpoint"
  vpc_id     = var.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = var.private_subnet_ids
}
```

### 3. IAM Policies for OpenSearch Integration

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:foundation-model/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aoss:APIAccessAll"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:aoss:*:*:collection/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
}
```

### 4. Access Controls

- S3 bucket policies restrict access to specific roles
- Lambda execution roles have minimal permissions
- KMS key policies allow only authorized services
- VPC endpoints for private AWS service communication

## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. State Management

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "ai-chatbot/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

### 2. Version Pinning

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Tagging Strategy

```hcl
common_tags = {
  Project     = var.project_name
  Environment = var.environment
  ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  Owner       = var.owner
  Purpose     = "ai-chatbot-infrastructure"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Development Environment

```bash
# Deploy with minimal configuration for development
terraform apply -var="environment=dev" -var="s3_force_destroy=true"
```
